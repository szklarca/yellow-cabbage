<p>In the movie “Center stage” the head of the American Ballet Company School promises new students that he and his fellow teachers are here to make them nto the best dancers they can be. Pressure will be high and if they are not made from dimond chances are they will break. Life at large is like that except 100 times more complex. You are your own student, mentor, teacher and guide. You have to invent your own art, grow your unique talents and skills and deliver your unique and beautifull contributions. Your role is to make yourself into the best version of a humna being you can be. When you create the pressure from within and take your true path you will not break nor wander off.</p>
